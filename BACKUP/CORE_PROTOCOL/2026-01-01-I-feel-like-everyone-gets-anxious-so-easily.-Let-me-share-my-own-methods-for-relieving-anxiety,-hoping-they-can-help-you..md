I feel like everyone gets anxious so easily. Let me share my own methods for relieving anxiety, hoping they can help you.

1. Often, anxiety stems from wasting time. Lying in bed every day, feeling like another day has been wasted, but not being able to change anything, makes it all the more unpleasant. At times like these, take out your phone and list the things you need to do the next day. Reviewing what you did the previous day before bed can greatly alleviate this anxiety.

2. Reading. I usually read when I'm in a bad mood! It really calms you down. As you read, many problems seem less like problems.

3. Do something you really enjoy to distract yourself from anxiety. Ideally, it shouldn't be something that brings instant gratification but leaves you feeling empty. Cultivate some long-term hobbies, like playing Lego or the piano. Doing things regularly and gradually becoming proficient at can provide a sense of security.

4. Whenever you feel anxious, panicked, or uneasy about the future, take out a pen and paper to analyze your current situation, your strengths and weaknesses, and how to improve. This concrete plan can alleviate the fear of the unknown.

5. Chat with friends. Sometimes it's easy to get stuck when you're alone. What you're facing might not be a problem, but rather your emotions. In these situations, chatting or having a meal with friends can often solve the problem to a large extent.

6. Always remember, emotions are paper tigers, and so is anxiety. When you actually take action to defeat it, you'll find yourself much stronger than you imagined.

7. Get things done. Get things done. Get things done.

8. Tidy up your room. Organize and tidy up to make your life more structured. Practice minimalism and regain control of your life by focusing on small things.

9. Love yourself. I believe many emotional problems stem from a lack of self-confidence. Solving this requires long-term effort, so praise and affirm yourself more, and learn to become the person you want to be. This will create a virtuous cycle.

Know that you always have the opportunity to become the person you want to be, so don't be afraid, and don't let the unknown defeat you.

Learn to save yourself.
