I think I like you.

Lately, I've been chatting with you a lot, sharing everything that happens in my life. Whether I get up early or late, where I go with friends, whether I had lobster for dinner, what I do if I have insomnia—I tell you everything.

I feel that letting you know my state of mind is the beginning of my feelings for you.

But I haven't told you how I feel. The feeling of having to find out if you like me back is awful. I hate guessing games, I hate uncertainty, I hate negative answers, so I haven't dared to say it.

A friend told me that this feeling of probing for someone's feelings is actually the most romantic; things like avoiding eye contact and hinting in words are things that disappear after falling in love. I think that makes a lot of sense, but I don't really enjoy it. I'm worried about how my feelings will end if we don't move forward.

Some people's gentleness is just their nature. Your concern for me might just be concern, not love. I understand that very well, but it's so easy to fall for someone who's being cared for. That's where things feel a little unfair.

I wish there were magic in the world, so that when two people who like each other are together, happy bubbles would appear above their heads. But until that magic appears, I will continue to like you.
