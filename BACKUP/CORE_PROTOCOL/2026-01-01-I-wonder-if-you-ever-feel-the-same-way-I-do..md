I wonder if you ever feel the same way I do.

Once you fall in love with someone, you give them everything you have, wanting to shower them with all the tenderness in the world. Whatever they want, you're more anxious and eager than they are; whatever they hate, you're more disgusted and weary than they are. A frown from them makes you anxious; a smile from them makes you smile too. And strangely, as time goes on, your affection for them doesn't diminish; it doubles.

Your way of loving is so old-fashioned and unconventional. You don't know the art of playing hard to get, nor do you understand the concept of maintaining distance. Being good to them is the simplest and most direct way for you to express your love.

However, as you treat them better and better, they become more and more casual and unappreciative.

What should have been a relationship between two people slowly turns into a one-sided love.

Over the weekend, while having dinner with a friend, she suddenly told me calmly that she wanted to break up. I was shocked; I had always thought she would marry her current boyfriend.

She and her boyfriend had been together for quite a while, and in my memory, she had always been incredibly good to him. How good? Once, we had dinner together. Everyone chatted casually, but she was busy rinsing and washing her boyfriend's dishes, constantly putting food on his plate throughout the meal.

Since they started dating, she's taken care of all his clothes, even buying him underwear. Last Singles' Day, she bought thirteen items, nine for her boyfriend, and of the remaining four, three were kitchen and bathroom supplies. She only bought herself a sweater.

Her boyfriend is a bit thin, so to help him gain weight, she squeezed in precious free time to enroll in a cooking class. Every day after get off work, she grabs a shopping basket and rushes to the supermarket to buy all sorts of nutritious meals for him.

We all think her boyfriend must have saved the galaxy in his past life to have such an amazing girlfriend.

But because she loves too much and is always the one giving, she's becoming increasingly passive in the relationship.

She clearly doesn't eat spicy food, but at first, her boyfriend would carefully choose restaurants to accommodate her tastes. Later, he casually took her to eat spicy hot pot. He ate with relish, while she drank several bottles of water throughout the meal.

She complained a bit about being tired from cleaning, but instead of helping, he angrily yelled at her: "It's too noisy! Can't you shut up?"

When they first started dating, he would pick her up from school no matter how late it was, and he would always buy her her favorite milk tea. But from some point on, the milk tea stopped, and he wouldn't come to pick her up even in thunderstorms.

Seeing other boyfriends holding umbrellas and embracing their girlfriends, she considered breaking up.

There are many things he could do, not because he couldn't, but because he didn't want to anymore. Like catering to your tastes, being tolerant of your emotions, protecting you, and taking you home.

He used to love you so much, how could someone so good change so suddenly?

Actually, he hasn't changed; he's just gotten used to it, while you've loved him more and more.

Everything is unfair, including love.

In love, the one who loves more is always the one giving, while the one being loved always easily receives favoritism and pity. It truly echoes the lyric: "The one who is loved doesn't need to apologize."

A classic question is: Do you want to date someone you love or someone who loves you?

Many people have thought, "I must be with the person I love; I must marry for love."

But now I don't think that way anymore.

Next time, I only want to date or marry someone who loves me more.

I will like him, but I must be sure that he will always like me more than I like him. Once he doesn't like me as much, I will tell myself it's time to leave, and comfort myself: "Thank goodness you don't like him as much."

I know this is selfish, unfair to the other person, but I'm sorry, I really don't want to get hurt anymore. Let me be selfish and be the one who is loved.

I'm a coward; I really don't want to lose again.
