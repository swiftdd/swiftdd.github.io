My best friend is getting married soon.

A few days ago, while we were having dinner, she suddenly started talking about her first love. She said wistfully, "I wonder how he's doing now."

She's a returned overseas master's graduate, from a wealthy family, highly educated, beautiful, and excellent in every way. But her first love dropped out of high school and ran a small food stall on the street corner, with a slightly roguish demeanor. They didn't seem like the kind of couple who could end up together, yet they stayed together for five years.

Back then, she was in high school and would ask me to go with her to that stall every day for rice cakes. The bowl of rice cakes the boy brought her would always be piled high with egg shreds.

During their sweetest period, she would even skip class to help him at the stall. Once, she almost bumped into her father, and she was so scared that she hid in the kitchen for over an hour, too afraid to come out.

Small-town romances have a natural charm, and the time they spent together perfectly matched the tender touches often found in youth novels. But later, the pages of that novel slowly became damp, and the words became illegible. Later, she went abroad. After a while, due to various conflicts, they finally broke up. After that, she didn't date for a long time.

I was an observer of the story, only able to piece it together chronologically. Only she knows how her heart has changed.

Anyway, what I know is that her current boyfriend is a lawyer in Shanghai. They dated for a year, met each other's parents, and both sides were satisfied, so the marriage was arranged smoothly. The lawyer is young and promising, from a good family, highly educated, handsome, and excellent in every way. They seemed like a perfect match.

"It's him, he's great," she said to me when talking about her current boyfriend.

She rarely mentioned her first love in recent years, and I thought she had long forgotten him. It surprised me when she suddenly brought him up while we were having dinner, close to her wedding date.

My best friend's breakup occurred as they transitioned from adolescence to adulthood. Their surroundings and life experiences began to diverge, leading to an imbalance in their compatibility.

"Do you feel regret?" I asked my best friend.

"It's alright. He's definitely not suitable for me to marry," my best friend said.

Yes. When it comes to marriage, "suitability" is the most important thing.

My best friend, a master's graduate from overseas, should naturally be matched with an industry elite. A good match, equal footing, is like putting a lock on the relationship when love enters marriage. It's a constraint, but also a safeguard.

When we're young, we often crave the ups and downs of romance, believing that as long as two people like each other, they can be together forever. But after entering the workforce, we yearn for a steady, long-lasting relationship, feeling that it doesn't need too many twists and turns, just stability and security. A rational and gentle love is what makes people feel at ease.

There's no good or bad. It's just growing up.

There's no right or wrong, just a sense of melancholy.

My cousin used to fight with her family over a relationship that wasn't well-regarded. Eventually, for some reason, she broke off the relationship with the man.

She's currently planning to get engaged to someone she met through a blind date. A few days ago, she brought her fiancé to my house for dinner. My mom asked her, "You're getting married soon, are you happy?"

She just said casually, "It's alright, it's fine as it is."

Often, we have to admit that once people reach a certain age, they suddenly lose a lot of fighting spirit. "It's alright," "It's okay," "It's acceptable"... every positive adjective is preceded by an adverb indicating a degree of indifference. Passionate love gives way to quiet marriage. At a certain age, most people choose to say goodbye to brave but clumsy infatuation and enter into a stable and secure marriage.

It's not about being worldly; I just feel sorry for her.

That little girl who hid in the kitchen for half a day, too afraid to come out, is now a capable career woman. She used to love that boy who made snacks, but now she's decided to marry a lawyer. In the future, she might become a stressed-out yet triumphant mother, her social media filled with parenting tips and mundane daily life. She will also face a lot of pressure—from the mortgage, from her 996 job, from arguments with her husband. She might occasionally think of the boy who served her so many shredded eggs, and sigh, "Youth is so wonderful," but she wouldn't truly want to go back.

Time doesn't have a rewind button; nostalgia is ultimately just a thought.

We... no longer have the luxury of acting recklessly in love.

Approaching thirty, we see this reality more acutely. So, almost out of self-preservation, we actively seek stable income, stable families, and stable relationships.

We no longer champion instant gratification or passionate love; we no longer believe in romance and adrenaline. We begin to value marital harmony and family peace, focusing on work efficiency and promotions. Because we need tangible financial security, we scoff at sentimental displays of affection that offer little return on investment.

Romance will always be killed. We will grow up, become wealthy or burdened with pressure, and we will meet smooth-talking, ambitious young men, calculating their backgrounds and income—and obviously, they will do the same for you.

We've tied love and livelihood together, and it's all too difficult. "Being with the one you love most" feels like an unattainable luxury.

But long ago, that was the kind of marriage we envisioned.
