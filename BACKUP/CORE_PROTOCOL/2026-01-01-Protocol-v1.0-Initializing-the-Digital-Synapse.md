# Protocol v1.0: Initializing the Digital Synapse

> System-Link: https://github.com/swiftdd/Synapse/discussions/2

## 🧠 System Overview
Welcome to **Synapse**. This is not just a repository; it is a decentralized cognitive archive designed to capture, process, and store high-entropy thoughts and technical insights.

By leveraging GitHub's core infrastructure as a backend, this protocol ensures that every "Neural Dump" is version-controlled, immutable, and instantly accessible via the global network.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
The system is powered by a custom-built automation engine:
- **Input Interface**: GitHub Discussions (for structured data entry)
- **Neural Link**: GitHub Actions (for real-time synchronization)
- **Knowledge Base**: GitHub Wiki (for deep-dive documentation)
- **Public Portal**: GitHub Pages (for minimalist, low-latency reading)

## 📂 Data Sections
My neural connections will be categorized into three primary streams:
1. **[CORE_PROTOCOL]**: System documentation and philosophical foundations.
2. **[TECH_STACK]**: Deep dives into software engineering, algorithms, and system architecture.
3. **[NEURAL_DUMP]**: High-speed, raw thoughts and cross-disciplinary inspirations.
