# I'm a really lazy person who's attached to the past.

I'm a really lazy person who's attached to the past.

Take eating, for example. I have a very fixed menu and favorite restaurants, including takeout. I always order from the same few places, and I only order a few specific dishes.

So much so that friends often ask me: "Don't you get tired of it? Why do you always eat the same things when there are so many new dishes?"

But actually, it's not that I don't want to try new things and see if they're good or not. I do look forward to seeing if they're good or not, but I'm still afraid. What if they're not good? Wouldn't I be very sad then?

It suddenly dawned on me that eating and relationships are similar. We're unwilling to try new menus, unwilling to try new relationships, not because we don't like them, but simply because we're afraid of disappointment.

In that instant, I understood what it means to be: I'm just a lazy person, and in relationships, I only want stability.
