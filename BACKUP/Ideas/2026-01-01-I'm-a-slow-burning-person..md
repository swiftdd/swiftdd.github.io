I'm a slow-burning person.

In real life, meeting the right person is actually quite difficult, and I happen to be seen as too picky by others. I used to think that meeting someone I liked was too hard, that even dating was a luxury.

Besides liking someone, understanding and companionship are more important. But when that person appears, you actually start to forget your initial intentions. I think that developing feelings over time and falling in love at first sight are not contradictory; both can develop into deep, ingrained feelings.

I'm also a strong-willed person; the more unattainable something is, the more I want it.

Looking back on my entire dating process, I really marvel at my own persistence. I truly pursued him step by step until I won him over. But I later realized that he had listened carefully to and remembered everything I casually said, and even acted on it without making a sound.

In my sophomore year of college, I also met someone who made my heart flutter, but things didn't go as planned. His actions made me feel that he didn't like me. I didn't have the courage then, and didn't dare to say it outright, which led me to do a series of foolish things.

He was a year ahead of me, an outstanding student, and incredibly approachable. Everyone thought he treated all girls equally.

I liked him, but I pretended to be indifferent, speaking with an air of nonchalance as if I didn't. Only I knew how overjoyed I was when he contacted me. At first, I just pretended to bump into him, then I started bringing him breakfast, and gradually, I started asking him out to dinner and movies, but I never expressed my feelings.

I'm proud, so why are straight men so clueless?

Didn't he realize it? No, he knew, but he just didn't want to say it. I gradually understood his meaning, and I started to feel disheartened. I stopped contacting him, wanting to wait for him to contact me.

But he didn't.

I couldn't take it anymore. At three in the morning, in the dark, I mustered up a tremendous amount of courage to contact him and wait for him downstairs. But I was unlucky; our dorms were actually several streets apart. I arrived at his dorm, and he arrived at mine.

It was raining when I saw him.

He stood upstairs, separated from me by a railing, before he saw me. I hadn't contacted him for a week, and I couldn't hold back anymore. His indifference to my feelings was too hurtful, too painful. I had nothing else to say.

"I like you, don't you really know?"

"Don't confess yet, it's raining, come inside quickly."

"No! Am I stupid? It's been so long, can't you feel it?"

"I know, I know everything!" Then he rushed down and pulled me inside. I thought back and forth… why did I blurt it out? How am I going to handle this awful atmosphere? He carefully poured me water and dried my hair, and suddenly I understood what he meant.

Actually, everything you think is true is just your thinking. While you were overthinking, he was overthinking too. But the most wonderful thing about feelings is that they are uncontrollable. Love is like force; it's mutual. When you look straight at glass, you can't see anything, but as long as there's a ray of sunlight and you adjust the angle, it will shine brightly. It's the same with liking people; often, as long as you're a little brave, you can be bathed in happiness.
