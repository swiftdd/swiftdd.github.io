# I haven't met anyone who truly likes me in a long time.

I haven't met anyone who truly likes me in a long time.

They just know me, think I meet their standards, and ask if I want to be with them. It has nothing to do with love; it's more about novelty.

I've heard too many sweet words, almost like I'd go through fire and water for them, but these so-called heroes don't even know my little habits. I just can't understand how someone can say they like someone like that. They might as well just say, "Let's have some fun," and I'd respect their honesty.

People these days are so impatient, and so am I. I don't even have the patience to wait for my hair to grow long. So everyone's started sifting through love like rice: this one's too fat, this one's too ugly, this one's not bad, I'll give it a try, if I can't, oh well.

Some say that old tricks always win people over, but the interesting thing is, love only begins the moment you decide to drop the tricks.

That's why I don't easily say I like someone; I always say I have a crush on someone. I have a lot of crushes, maybe a dozen or twenty a year. Crushes are nothing new. Maybe I'll have a crush on someone just because I think they look really cool playing basketball. It's like the wind; it feels nice when it blows into my heart, but then it just drifts away.
