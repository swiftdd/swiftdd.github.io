I often ask myself what kind of relationship I really want.

After several failed relationships, I realized that all I've been searching for on this path of love is a comfortable relationship—one where we understand each other.

A few days ago, a good friend told me she'd finally found love. I asked if it was with a guy who was really good to her, and she nodded.

Three months ago, my friend told me a guy was pursuing her, but neither his personality nor his looks were her type. More importantly, after two deeply painful relationships, experiencing that mutually agonizing struggle, she declared to us that she would never date again. She was truly scared enough and didn't want to like anyone anymore.

I asked my friend why she chose this boy, and she told me, "I find being with him incredibly comfortable. Sometimes, even when we sit together without talking, it's never awkward. When we eat, he instinctively orders my favorite dishes. He doesn't pursue me with grand gestures, but he's always there for me when I need him."

Listening to her describe her daily life with her boyfriend, looking at her profile—so sweet and content, so peaceful—I'm honestly so envious.

Perhaps this is what good love is like: no fixed rituals, no hesitant anxieties, just naturalness, understanding, and comfort.

I saw a quote on Weibo: "Only those who have experienced good love understand that good love is something you can easily obtain, something that doesn't leave you heartbroken or frustrated. Those persistent loves that cause you pain each have their own unbearable aspects."

I believe we've all experienced a less-than-ideal relationship, where every step we took felt like walking on thin ice. His indifference made me insecure, constantly wondering if he truly loved me. I hid my flaws to pretend I was perfect, and every conversation was fraught with anxiety, afraid of saying anything that would upset him.

This feeling was exhausting.

A good relationship is one where you don't have to desperately try to win him over; he provides enough security. Even when you throw tantrums, he'll act like a mature man, forgiving and understanding your quirks, knowing the meaning behind your every pout and stomp, and knowing when to be there for you.

Seeing him makes me incredibly happy, and even when he's not around, I don't feel anxious. There's no need to compete or cling to each other constantly, because I'm certain he loves me. No need for grand pronouncements; a warm hug and the words "I'm here for you" are enough.

The person most worthy of your love, the person you can entrust your life to, is definitely the one who makes you feel comfortable in their presence.

They won't try to outsmart you or force their own dating model on you; instead, they're willing to compromise and be understanding.

They won't prioritize their own appearance in the cold wind; instead, they'll turn around and wrap your scarf around your neck, then put your cold hands in their pockets.

Ultimately, isn't the point of a relationship to be comfortable and happy?

Life is already tough and tiring enough; I don't want to be caught up in the scheming and overthinking of a relationship. I just want to be loved gently by you, hand in hand, through a peaceful and ordinary life.

So, if you're going to struggle through a relationship only to gain nothing, just let it go. True love doesn't need to be painstakingly cultivated; it's about both of you becoming better versions of yourselves when they're by your side. It's about feeling incredibly comfortable without having to force anything or change anything.

As I get older, let those dramatic, pretentious, and artificial relationships go. I just want to be with people I feel comfortable with.
