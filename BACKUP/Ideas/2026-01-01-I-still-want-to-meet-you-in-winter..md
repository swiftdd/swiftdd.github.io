I still want to meet you in winter.

I want to take you to that roasted chestnut stall on the corner where I used to buy them when I was alone. The owner always gives me a few extra whenever he sees me.

I want to go to a steaming hot pot restaurant with you, order a table full of meat, and then leave a pitiful plate of vegetables in the corner. I want to know if you also like milk tea with taro paste. I want to do all the whimsical, warm things with you that are worth wasting time on.

But it's definitely not because winter makes people too vulnerable.

It's not that I necessarily need someone else by my side. It's that I genuinely feel winter is the most romantic season, and I only want to share this romance with you.

It's the untrodden snow-covered paths, the streets filled with peaceful and joyful Christmas music, the beautifully decorated intersections, and countless moments when I want to embrace you.

It's wanting to love you in winter, to be with you through all the cold and low moments, and then become the one who can accompany you through spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
