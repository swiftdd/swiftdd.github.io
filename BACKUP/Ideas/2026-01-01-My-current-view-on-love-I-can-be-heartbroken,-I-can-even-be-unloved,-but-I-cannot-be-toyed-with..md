My current view on love: I can be heartbroken, I can even be unloved, but I cannot be toyed with.

A broken ending is acceptable, but I absolutely cannot feel scorned or lose my self-respect. I don't just seek happy endings in relationships, but the kind of heartbreak I envision in love is like La La Land—both people loved each other, and they separated only when all else failed, so that years later, upon meeting again, the memories would still be overwhelming.

But if a story with someone only involves my own pain, it's meaningless. It has nothing to do with happy endings or not; how can you use the word "ending"? It never even began.

Sometimes I think that when recounting my stories with certain people, there's no need to agonize over whether to choose a grand narrative or a subtle portrayal, because this story never truly began.

My life after leaving that person is very self-consistent. I work methodically every day, allocating time for every little thing. If I can use an app, I won't go to the trouble myself; I can't stand wasting time. I precisely seek out books that are beneficial to me and read them word for word. I consistently buy luxury goods every year.

Look, I've planned everything out. How could I accept liking someone so fickle?

I've lost my giving personality in relationships; it's vanished. I'd rather be seen as stingy, as "unreasonably selfish," than give so much from the start. Ideally, no one would see through my feelings. I used to be unafraid of these things; I thought the worst that could happen was rejection. But I've realized that's not the case. My heart might be left hanging, used, caught between being tactful and hoping for the best, repeatedly torn apart. These feelings far outweigh the weight of not being liked.

Sometimes I wonder, if I were prettier, would you like me? If I were richer, could we be together? If my temper changed, if I toned down my demands… But more often, thinking about how difficult every step I took towards you was, I think, I don't need to go through this.

Some relationships are simply: you don't actually need to go through this.
