We often learn how to love only after we've lost something.

Thankfully, life includes sadness and disappointment, which help us evolve into better versions of ourselves through countless involuntary efforts.

Many people become fearful after being hurt in relationships. They lose faith in love, perhaps out of fear of being hurt again. Once bitten, twice shy, it becomes a persistent curse, reminding us not to repeat the same mistakes and casting a lingering shadow over future relationships.

A friend asked me, "After everything you've been through, do you still believe in love?" I answered with certainty, "Of course."

I think love is probably a lot like air. You breathe constantly, and air is always there. You can't say there's no air just because you can't see it, nor can you say there's no oxygen just because there's carbon dioxide. So, whether you believe it or not, love is still love; it's still there.

Even if "we" don't end up together, eventually the right person will replace the old one. When that time comes, you'll realize that all these changes are normal. Those who have loved know that no matter how much you miss the past, you can't get anything back. If a relationship teaches you how to love, it's a gift the other person left you. You can only remind yourself that the more you lament the past, the more you should cherish the present.

Slowly, everyone will understand that not being able to be with the person you love is actually a normal part of life.

Even if people who separate don't stay together, they should live happily in their own worlds to avoid wasting the love they once shared.

The initial desire for love is happiness. The simplest love is having someone who loves you when you understand love, and you love them back—that's the best. If possible.

I wish you all could meet such a person, someone who is young even at sixty, open and honest, with a radiant smile, someone who risks everything to show you that the world is ultimately beautiful, and even if it's not, you still have him, someone worth taking the risk to reach out and hug.
