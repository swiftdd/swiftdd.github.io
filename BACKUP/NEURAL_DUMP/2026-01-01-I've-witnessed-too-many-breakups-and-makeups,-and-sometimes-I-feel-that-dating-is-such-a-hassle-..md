I've witnessed too many breakups and makeups, and sometimes I feel that dating is such a hassle.

You have to get to know another person from scratch, you have to test and accept each other, and you have to try to make the other person like you while tolerating their flaws. You can't interfere with their social circle, you can't be too clingy, and you can't demand their company when they're busy. Otherwise, you're considered immature, you don't understand them, and you're giving them a terrible relationship.

Over time, many people become hesitant to definitively say they've fallen in love, starting to worry about whether their behavior is disliked. They try not to trouble their partner, silently digest their grievances, and restrain their possessiveness to avoid putting pressure on them. It seems like this is what adult love should be like.

I don't know if the other person feels relieved, but this isn't what I initially wanted.

I still want to express my love unrestrainedly, to pour all my emotions into him, to completely possess him while being meticulously considerate. I want to feel his tension, to be moved by every subtle emotion in him.

I feel like this is what a relationship I've truly invested my heart in is like.

If you call this naive, then so be it. I just want a love where I don't have to worry about right or wrong, where we're always loyal to each other, and where I never have to worry about it changing.
