I cherish pure love.

Many years ago, I could unilaterally like someone for four or five years without receiving a response.

Pure, bright, unpretentious, and genuine. During those years, I rejected all ambiguity and other boys, even feeling a touch of pride when I said, "I already have someone I like."

In those years of liking, there were no impurities, no ulterior motives. I simply gave my heart. You didn't have to reciprocate; I wouldn't press you. Looking back, it seems naive, but it remains bright.

"Brightness" is my highest expectation for relationships. To like openly, to treat gently, to not worry about the outcome, and to have a clear conscience.

In recent years, I've begun to understand and try to accept that a person's heart can hold many people at the same time, and that love can be divided among different people. Some people like you, but also like others. Anyone can be replaced, abandoned. Sincerity becomes rare, but it also loses its value.

I've been single for a long time, and I can hardly remember what it felt like to hug a boy who stirred my heart. I want to hold hands during the day, stroll at night, embrace in the street, and kiss under the streetlights. The essence of love is possession and exclusivity. I can accept that someone has many people in their heart at the same time, but I still want to give my whole heart only to one person, to be filled only by one person.

Years have changed, and people have changed too.

But even now, I want to love passionately and brightly.
