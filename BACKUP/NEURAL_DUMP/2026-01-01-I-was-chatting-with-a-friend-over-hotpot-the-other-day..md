I was chatting with a friend over hotpot the other day.

We were reminiscing about little things from our university days, like "walking slowly with our bikes at dusk."

As we talked, I remarked that youth "is something you'll miss no matter how it went at the time." I laughed and said, "Why? Because after growing up, I realized that so many things are just too difficult."

What I've found difficult lately is expressing my frustrations to others.

Before, I wouldn't even express my frustrations to others; I was even allowed to "cry freely," without holding back my emotions. Back then, I just felt that I wanted to cry, so I had to cry—even in front of my friends. My friends back then had all cried in front of each other; we never felt that crying was inappropriate or a disturbance to each other.

Later, I discovered that I had very few people I could confide in.

I confided in a friend once, and he said to me, "Do you know that you can't just tell other people about your struggles?" I asked why, and he said, "Because they might not want to hear it."

I said, "I know." Looking back now, I wonder how I ever faced such a blunt moment. Without careful reflection, it seems "no big deal," but upon closer examination, it's like, "Wow, is this what the adult world is like?"

Finding someone willing to genuinely listen to why you're unhappy lately is so, so, so difficult.

I cried once in front of a friend last year because of a very difficult, unexpected problem. From the moment my eyes started to redden, I told myself, "You can't cry," but… I just couldn't help it.

After crying, I felt incredibly guilty.

But I don't really enjoy crying alone. I don't have a strong desire to perform, but I do want people to know that I can be sad.

I can't ask my friends to do that; I just hope that the sense of security of "being able to cry" exists between me and my partner.

One of the many New Year's wishes I've made is that I can openly acknowledge "I'm unhappy," express it, cry, and find someone willing to accept it when necessary.

Beautiful words are never lacking between people; what's lacking is that moment when you see my soul pale and you feel a mixture of surprise and complexity, yet you don't walk away. To "open your heart" and share vulnerability with each other is, in my eyes, one of the most difficult things in the world.

Some people have everything, except someone they can cry in front of when they want to.

A friend told me she once liked an extremely rational boy who would frown and ask her when she was about to cry, "Do you think crying will help?" Hearing this made her even sadder, so she told him, "Of course I know it won't help, but I just feel bad. Is it wrong to feel bad?"

I think love really only needs two words: "honesty." In front of others, I try my best to be as "appropriate as possible." I know that a relationship that isn't that close shouldn't become a burden.

But you are my other half.

When I'm wronged, I genuinely want to tell you everything. I'm not here for advice, or even for comfort. Just listen to me cry it out, say, "Baby, you've been wronged," and give me a big hug. That's all, really.

But it's strange, almost everyone I meet seems unwilling to listen.

There's a saying that's very true: emotions are part of our being, they need to be cared for, but we often hide them, ignore them, and even feel guilty about them.

Before learning to take care of my emotions, I chose to learn how to make money first. I only considered confiding in someone or taking a break at the beach when I was completely exhausted. For a while, I felt incredibly stressed every night, but I was so busy with work that I didn't have time to think about taking care of myself.

"Work first."

But my life is so good; I don't want to waste it on bad emotions.

What I want is happiness, really. This happiness doesn't need many conditions. For example, if I could cry, I just wanted a hug. I don't need to find a place where no one can see me, I don't need to suppress my emotions. "Get up where you fall," I know, but just let me cry for a little while.

I haven't met many people like that before.

I've heard, "Don't you know you can't just tell others about your suffering?" I've seen people turn away impatiently. I want to tell them, I'm not trying to appear pitiful, I'm just naturally prone to crying, and sometimes it's hard to hold back. Please don't let me see that gap between people, that gap that can never be bridged, that gap between souls, okay?

I really want to find someone who's willing to see me cry. I still yearn for that kind of genuine closeness—a closeness that transcends politeness and caution, a closeness based on emotion and state of mind—in this bustling city.

I don't want to live a life where I can't find anyone to cry to. Have you found someone willing to see you cry?
