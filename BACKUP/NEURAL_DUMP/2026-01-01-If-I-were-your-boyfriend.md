# If I were your boyfriend

If I were your boyfriend:

**I would be the kind of guy who cherishes you to the core, whose eyes are always on you. I would know your likes and dislikes, and what you're afraid of.**

You can be a little childish sometimes, unreasonable, jealous, sensitive, and prone to overthinking, so feel free to look at my phone and WeChat.

I would be able to reject all advances and temptations from other men, cutting off any potential paths. I would hold your hand when we walk, helping you with things you can't do or the details you might not think of.

_If you're angry, I would comfort you immediately, and we would help each other correct our respective flaws._

I would tell you in advance where I'm going and what I'm doing.

I wouldn't suddenly disappear and make you worry and overthink; I would make you feel completely safe.

I wouldn't lie to you or hide anything from you. I would always keep my promises and love you dearly.
