I find this kind of relationship very comfortable.

Good relationships don't always require instant replies.

Sometimes I'm willing to share everything I see with you, whether it's a funny joke, a heartfelt essay, or a song. I don't need to carefully craft a concise explanation. Even if I ramble on, I'm not afraid of saying anything wrong and upsetting you.

I don't wait for a reply after posting, because I know you'll see it eventually.

I'm not afraid you'll become perfunctory if I post too much, because I know you'll enthusiastically respond to every single one of my messages.

I think this is probably trust, and the security of never being abandoned.
