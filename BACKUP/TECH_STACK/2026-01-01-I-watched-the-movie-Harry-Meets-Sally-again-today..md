I watched the movie *Harry Meets Sally* again today.

There's a line I really like: "When you know who you want to spend the rest of your life with, you hope that the rest of your life begins as soon as possible."

When we really like someone, we want to dive in headfirst, without thinking about the ending of the relationship, without considering how far the two of us can go. We just become more certain of our feelings as we get to know each other, and then suddenly we think: This is the person I want, I want to be with him.

A while ago, I saw a friend post this: "I was supposed to be wandering the world, but after meeting you, I think I can take a break."

I asked her in the comments if she was in a relationship. She replied with a shy emoji, which I took as an admission.

Later, she called me.

She said she'd known this guy for three months. Although it wasn't long, she already knew him well enough, and she felt comfortable with him, without needing to hide anything, relaxed and at ease.

She's someone who desperately lacks a sense of security, and the guy tries very hard to make her feel secure and reliable.

For example, he always tells her where he goes and what he does, and he even sends her photos of the surroundings. If he has something to do in the middle of a conversation, he won't disappear without a word, leaving her waiting in vain. She doesn't like him playing games all the time, so he can video call her all night.

When she needs him, she can always reach him; when she needs companionship, he's always there, never disappearing without a trace and making her panic.

She never asked for these small things, but he was always willing to do them.

A girl's affection for someone is built up slowly through these kinds of details.

She's always been a very rational person in relationships.

Having been hurt in her previous relationship, she has a defensive attitude towards men. She's met many guys, but missed out on them all because she felt she wasn't ready.

For her, accepting someone and starting a new relationship is a very difficult thing to do.

She thoroughly enjoyed being single, finding joy in her own company, and worried that someone might intrude and disrupt her life.

Until she met this guy, she suddenly realized that being in a relationship brought her more than just sweetness; it provided support, filling the emptiness in her heart.

I asked her what she liked about this guy.

She said that whenever she encountered trouble and felt anxious, his presence brought her an unprecedented sense of security. She cherished every moment spent with him, their relationship was incredibly harmonious, and they always had endless things to talk about.

Love begins with appearance, deepens with talent, and remains loyal to character. Love is wanting no one else but him, a firm conviction that no one else can treat you better. Love is always thinking of you first, wanting to share everything, good and bad, with you.

If someone can bring you a lot of peace and unprecedented happiness, your relationship is relaxed, you have so much to say to each other, he's willing to spend time with you, and he walks towards you without fear. So, this person must be your destiny.

I hope everyone has something to do, someone to love, and something to look forward to.
